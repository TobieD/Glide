#Glide

##Game Description

You play as a paper plane, in an endless level where you try to get as far
as possible from your starting position, gathering points based on your
distance, and encountering positive and negative pickups and direction
changing objects, as well as obstacles.

The game has no narrative or story-like objective, but it borrows from
endless runner type experiences in which your score is based mainly on
the distance you travel. With the addition of pickups, and the fact that
levels are randomly generated from a set list of prefabs.
